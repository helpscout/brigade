## What is Brigade?

Brigade is a library that enhances Backbone/Marionette views providing
consumers with a declarative interface to:

- Mount one or more React components into a Backbone/Marionette view
- Syncronize the React components with the state of Backbone models
- Reduce synchronized state to computed/derived props that your React components require

## Is Brigade for me?

If you are integrating React components into a legacy Backbone/Marionette
application than Brigade may be a good fit for your project.

If you are simply looking for a state management solution for your React
project, then Brigade is not for you. In this case, try
[Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux),
[MobX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx) or one of many more solutions.

## Dependencies

Brigade has the following peer dependencies:

- [Backbone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone)
- [Cocktail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone.cocktail)
- [Marionette](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone.marionette) (Optional)
- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [React DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

Backbone requires jQuery and Underscore.

## Installation
