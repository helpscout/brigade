# Introduction

## What is Brigade?

Brigade is a library that enhances Backbone/Marionette views providing
a declarative interface to:

- Mount one or more React components into a Backbone/Marionette view
- Syncronize React components with the state of Backbone collections and models
- Use actions defined in a Backbone/Mariotte app inside a React component

## Is Brigade for me?

If you are integrating React components into a legacy Backbone/Marionette
application than Brigade may be a good fit for your project.

If you are simply looking for a state management solution for your React
project, then Brigade is not for you. In this case, try
[MobX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx),
[Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux),
[Unistore](https://github.com/developit/unistore) or one of many more solutions.

## Dependencies

Brigade has the following peer dependencies:

- [Backbone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone)
- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [React DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

The following peer dependencies are optional:

- [Marionette](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone.marionette)

Note that Backbone requires jQuery and underscore.
