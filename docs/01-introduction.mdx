# Introduction

## What is Brigade?

Brigade is a library that enhances Backbone or Marionette views. It provides a
couple of abstractions for:

- Mounting one or more React components into a Backbone or Marionette view
- Keeping React components in sync with Backbone collections and models
- Using actions defined in a Backbone or Marionette view with a React component

## Is Brigade for me?

If you are integrating React components into a legacy Backbone or Marionette
application than Brigade may be a good fit for your project.

Brigade will allow you to mix and match your
Backbone/Marionette code and React code allowing for seamless use of React
in Backbone/Marionette applications as well as providing a migration path to
a React-only application.

Use brigade.ReactView to replace ItemViews in a Marionette application with
a React component.

Use brigade.ReactMounter to mount React components or entire React apps
in a Backbone or Marionette view.

If any of this sounds useful, carry on. If you are just looking for a state
management solution for your project, then Brigade is not for you. In this case,
try
[MobX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx),
[Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux),
[Unistore](https://www.npmjs.com/package/unistore) or another solution.
