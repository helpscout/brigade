# External Reducers

## Overview

External Reducers is a Brigade utility for cases when a Backbone Model or Collection contains stateful information
that is needed inside the Redux application. Creating an External Reducer will sync changes on the Model/Collection
to a corresponding slice of state inside the Redux store.

We accomplish this with Brigade's `createStore` function, which allows you to pass a `reducers: {}` object that contains
both regular reducer functions *and* Backbone Models/Collections. When `createStore` detects a Backbone entity, it
will automatically create an External Reducer, which will be kept up to date as the entity mutates.


## createStore

```
import { createStore } from '@helpscout/brigade'
import internalReducers from './reducers'

const user = new Backbone.Model({ name: 'Bobby McGee' })
const customers = new Backbone.Collection([])
const reducers = {
  ...internalReducers,
  user,
  customers,
}

const preloadedState = {
  user: user.toJSON(),
  customers: customers.toJSON(),
}

const store = createStore({ reducers, preloadedState })

const StatefulView = StatefulReactView().extend({
  template() {
    // Uses Containers with react-redux's connect() function
    return <SomeApp/>
  }
})
region.show(new StatefulView({ store })

// StatefulView updates automatically as the model/collection changes
user.set({ name: 'Janis Joplin' })
```

## Advanced Usage

Behind the scenes, `createStore` leverages a `createExternalReducer` helper, a low-level utility
which creates a reducer function and a `reset` action creator. If you need more granular control
over the Backbone -> Redux data flow, this helper is exposed and can be used directly.

## createExternalReducer

```
import { createExternalReducer } from '@helpscout/brigade'
import internalReducers from './reducers'

const { reducer, reset } = createExternalReducer('user')
const reducers = {
  ...internalReducers,
  reducer,
}
const preloadedState = {
  user: userModel.toJSON()
}

const store = createStore({ preloadedState, reducers })
// Can manually control when the reset action is dispatched which will update the `user` slice
userModel.on('some-special-event', () => store.dispatch(reset(userModel.toJSON())))
```
