# StatefulReactView

StatefulReactView is a higher order function (HOF) that ships with Brigade since 1.0.4.

> StatefulReactView requires Marionette 1.8.x

## Overview

StatefulReactView builds off of ReactView with a dead simple `template` method that allows you to return a React
Component in lieu of an HTML string.

What's different is that whereas ReactView expects you to manually pass any props you may want in to the React Component
in `template()`, StatefulReactView expects to be passed a Redux `store`, which it smashes into a `<Provider>` and wraps
around the Component returned from `template()`.

This is a very powerful pattern which allows for a completely React/Redux-based development to occur inside the app,
with a Redux store being passed in from outside, typically at the Router/Controller level.

**StatefulReactView is considered best practice for building complex React/Redux apps inside Marionette**

## Basic Usage

```
import {StatefulReactView, createStore} from '@helpscout/brigade'
// regular old Redux reducers
import reducers from './reducers'
import React from 'react'

const preloadedState = { todos: [] }
// All application state and logic lives in the Redux store
const store = createStore({ reducers, preloadedState })
const TodoAppView = StatefulReactView().extend({
  template(props) {
    return <TodoApp {...props} />
  }
}))

region.show(new TodoAppView({ store }))
```

In the above example, the TodoApp is rendered inside a `<Provider>` containing the
`store`, allowing use of Containers with `react-redux`'s `connect`.

## createStore and Communication with Legacy App

By default, `createStore` will include [thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk),
and allows you to define an `extraArgument` which will be provided to your action
creators as described [here](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk#injecting-a-custom-argument).
This is a very powerful pattern in a React-inside-Backbone context, because it
allows your Redux action creators to access external resources or APIs from your
legacy application.

```
// Some old error notification function
const extraArgument = { legacyDisplayError }
const store = createStore({ reducers, preloadedState, extraArgument })

// actions/api.js
export const fetchUserError = errorMessage => (dispatch, getState, {legacyDisplayError}) => {
  legacyDisplayError(errorMessage)
}
```

## Ideal Use Case: Pure Internal State

The ideal use case for StatefulReactView is to rewrite a large, high-level
chunk of a Marionette Application with a React-Redux application. It represents
the penultimate stage of Reactification: just before the Backbone app is
completely consumed. A good example would be using StatefulReactView to build
a major page underneath a Backbone Route.

## Handling External State

Sometimes in legacy Backbone Applications undergoing rewrites to React, it is
necessary to use pieces of state that live in legacy Backbone Models or Collections.
`StatefulReactView` can be used in conjunction with a few opt-in helpers to allow specific
slices of Redux state to be managed externally, via Backbone Models and Collections.

### createExternalReducer

Redux does not allow you to directly mutate state. That's kind of the whole point.
This means that in order for us to allow a slice of Redux state to be controlled
by an external entity, we need a way to simply update or reset a slice of state
the Redux way: dispatching an action.

Enter `createExternalReducer`. This utility creates a generic, simple reducer
and a `reset` action-creator which can be used to reset the slice of state you wish
to be controlled externally. For example, if you have a `UserModel` you need to keep
around, and you want to access `user` state inside the Redux application, you can
achieve this like so:

```
import { createExternalReducer } from '@helpscout/brigade'
import internalReducers from './reducers'

const { reducer, reset } = createExternalReducer('user')
const reducers = {
  ...internalReducers,
  user
}
const preloadedState = {
  user: userModel.toJSON()
}

const store = createStore({ preloadedState, reducers })
// When the user model changes, dispatch the reset action which will overwrite the slice
userModel.on('change', () => store.dispatch(reset(userModel.toJSON())))

```

This gives you a fairly straightforward way to inject externally-controlled Redux slices
into your React application. However, manually binding to model events and dispatching the
`reset(newState)` entails a lot of boilerplate, so Brigade also provides a more opinionated
convenience method: `createExternalReducers`

### createExternalReducers
`createExternalReducers` is built off of `createExternalReducer`, and allows you to pass a map
of Models and Collections, and returns a map of `externalReducers`, a starting `externalState`,
and an `unbindAll` method for cleanup. This helper will automatically figure out whether
entries are models or collections, and listen for the appropriate `change`, `add`, `remove` or
`reset` events, and automatically dispatch `reset(newState)` actions, ensuring that the
Backbone-controlled slices of Redux state are kept in sync with their parent entities.

This is very similar to what `ReactMounter` does behind the scenes, but unlike `ReactMounter`,
you can create ordinary Redux reducers and actions alongside any externally-controlled reducers.
This means that most of the React application can be built in pure React/Redux; any Backbone-
-controlled `externalReducers` appear as ordinary state values inside your component layer,
and these can be replaced with pure Redux state management at your convenience.

### Advanced Usage
```
import { createExternalReducer } from '@helpscout/brigade'
import internalReducers from './reducers'

let store
// Creates a map of reducers which auto-update as the model or collection's state changes
const { externalReducers, externalState } = createExternalReducers({
  user: userModel,
  customers: customersCollection
}, () => store)

const reducers = {
  ...internalReducers,
  ...externalReducers
}
const preloadedState = {
  ...internalState,
  ...externalState,
}

// Expose any callbacks that the React app needs to interact with the model/collection
const extraArgument = { fetchCustomers: () => customersCollection.fetch() }
store = createStore({ preloadedState, reducers, extraArgument })

// actions/index.js
export const fetchCustomerList = () => (dispatch, getState, { fetchCustomers }) => {
  dispatch({ type: START_LOADING })
  // Call the external api to fetch the `customerCollection`
  fetchCustomers()
    .finally(dispatch({ type: STOP_LOADING })
}
```
