# StatefulReactView

StatefulReactView is a higher order function (HOF) that ships with Brigade since 1.1.0

> StatefulReactView requires Marionette 1.8.x

## Overview

StatefulReactView builds off of ReactView with a dead simple `template` method that allows you to return a React
Component in lieu of an HTML string.

What's different is that whereas ReactView expects you to manually pass any props you may want in to the React Component
in `template()`, StatefulReactView expects to be passed a Redux `store`, which it smashes into a `<Provider>` and wraps
around the Component returned from `template()`.

This is a very powerful pattern which allows for a completely React/Redux-based development to occur inside the app,
with a Redux store being passed in from outside, typically at the Router/Controller level.

**StatefulReactView is considered best practice for building complex React/Redux apps inside Marionette**

## Basic Usage

```
import {StatefulReactView, createStore} from '@helpscout/brigade'
// regular old Redux reducers
import reducers from './reducers'
import React from 'react'

const preloadedState = { todos: [] }
// All application state and logic lives in the Redux store
const store = createStore({ reducers, preloadedState })
const TodoAppView = StatefulReactView().extend({
  template(props) {
    return <TodoApp {...props} />
  }
}))

region.show(new TodoAppView({ store }))
```

## Ideal Use Case: Pure Internal State

The ideal use case for StatefulReactView is to rewrite a large, high-level
chunk of a Marionette Application with a React-Redux application. It represents
the penultimate stage of Reactification: just before the Backbone app is
completely consumed. A good example would be using StatefulReactView to build
a major page underneath a Backbone Route.

Brigade exposes a [createStore](/external-reducers#createstore) method to help initialize Redux store
for use with `StatefulReactView`. In cases where the internal React application needs to access
external legacy callbacks or APIs, this can be achieved [using `extraArgument`](/exposing-external-methods).

## Handling External State

Sometimes in legacy Backbone Applications undergoing rewrites to React, it is
necessary to use pieces of state that live in legacy Backbone Models or Collections.
`StatefulReactView` can be used in conjunction with a few opt-in helpers to allow specific
slices of Redux state to be managed externally, via Backbone Models and Collections.

Brigade allows you to inject externally-managed state through the use of [External Reducers](/external-reducers).
