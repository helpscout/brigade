# Introduction to Brigade

Brigade is a library that enhances Backbone/Marionette views providing
consumers with a declarative interface to:

- Mount one or more React components into a Backbone/Marionette view
- Syncronize React components with the state of Backbone collections and models

## Is Brigade for me?

If you are integrating React components into a legacy Backbone/Marionette
application than Brigade may be a good fit for your project.

If you are simply looking for a state management solution for your React
project, then Brigade is not for you. In this case, try
[Redux](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redux),
[MobX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mobx) or one of many more solutions.
