# Exposing External Methods

## Overview

An important capability in React/Redux applications embedded in Backbone pages is the ability to expose
external methods and callbacks that live in the legacy application.

## extraArgument

By default, [createStore](/external-reducers#createstore) will include [thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk),
and allows you to define an `extraArgument` which will be provided to your action
creators as described [here](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk#injecting-a-custom-argument).
This is a very powerful pattern in a React-inside-Backbone context, because it
allows your Redux action creators to access external resources or APIs from your
legacy application.

```
// Some old error notification function
const extraArgument = { legacyDisplayError }
const store = createStore({ reducers, preloadedState, extraArgument })

// actions/api.js
export const fetchUserError = errorMessage => (dispatch, getState, {legacyDisplayError}) => {
  legacyDisplayError(errorMessage)
}
```

This pattern is helpful because it allows you to hide external methods from your Component layer, and
easily mock external methods when writing tests for your action dispatchers, which are the only
place in your React/Redux application which need to be aware of these external methods or APIs.
