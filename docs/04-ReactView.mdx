# ReactView

ReactView is a higher order function (HOF) that ships with Brigade since 1.0.0.

## Overview

ReactView enhances a Marionette ItemView such that it can use React components
as templates.

Views can implement a `template` method that accepts `props` as the argument.
The props are the options passed to the view when it was instantiated. The
method should return a component with those props.

## Basic Usage

```
import {ReactView} from '@helpscout/brigade'
import Marionette from 'backbone.marionette'
import React from 'react'

const ComponentView = ReactView(Marionette.ItemView.extend({
  template(props) {
    return <HeaderComponent {...props} />
  }
}))

const view = new ComponentView({
  title: 'My Header'
})

```

In the above example, the view is rendered with the title prop, 'My Header'.

## Ideal Use Case

The ideal use case for ReactView is 1:1 replacement of Marionette ItemViews
with React components. For example, ReactView could be used to replace the
ItemViews in a CompositeView with ReactComponents but the business logic and
the rest of the user interface is still implemented in Marionette.
