# ReactMounter

ReactMounter is a higher order function (HOF) that ships with Brigade since
1.0.0. It replaces the default export from Brigade 0.x.

## Overview

In a nutshell, ReactMounter enhances a Backbone or Marionette View. You may
add a property or method to your View called `components`. This property or
method should evaluate to a map of key-value pairs, where the keys are
`selectors` and the values are any of the following:

1. A React component class or function
2. A React component instance
3. A builder object

We generically refer to the values in those key-value pairs as the `builder`.

ReactMounter is declarative in that the `components` property will be evaluated
and for each selector in the `components`, the corresponding React component
is built and mounted into the first node in the template that matches the
selector. This happens on render in the view life cycle.

Simply declare the React components you want to mount and where you want to
mount them. ReactMounter will do the heavy lifting.

Not only will ReactMounter mount components into the DOM. It will also give you
the following for free:

- Enhance each component with a state
- Watch collections and models passed as props for changes and sychronize them with the state
- Enhance each component with a store if given an initial state
- Watch collections and models passed as initial state for changes and sychronize them with the store
- Cast collections and models passed as props to plain JavaScript objects
- Inject external methods into the store

...and that's not all!

Brigade exports a `connect` HOF that can be used to map the state of the store
to props on a component. It can also be used to map external methods in the
store to props on a component.

### Basic Usage

1. Import the `ReactMounter` HOF into your view file.
2. Include a `components` property or method in your view.
3. Invoke the `ReactMounter` HOF with your view as the argument.

```javascript
import {ReactMounter} from '@helpscout/brigade'
import Marionette from 'backbone.marionette'
import React from 'react'
import _ from 'underscore'

import Button from '@helpscout/hsds-react/components/Button'

const FormView = ReactMounter(Marionette.View.extend({
  components: {
    '.js-button': <Button primary submit>Save</Button>
  },

  // This can also be written as:
  // components() {
  //   return {
  //     'js-button': <Button primary submit>Save</Button>
  //   }
  // },

  template: _.template(`
    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <label>Email address</label>
        <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" />
      </fieldset>
      <div class="js-button"></div>
    </form>
  `),
}))

```

In the example above, when the view is rendered, the `Button` component will
be mounted into the `div` with the className of `js-button`.

The `components` property or method is a powerful construct. Read on for more
advanced usage.

## The Components Property or Method

The `components` property or method on ReactMounter-enhanced views can take
few different shapes. In its simplest form, we can define a property assigned
an object literal.

```javascript
components: {
  '#app': App,
}
```

In the above example, the `App` component will be mounted in the first node
in the DOM that matches the `#app` selector.

Since we can use instances of a React component, it's possible to set props
on the component too.

```
components: {
  '#app': <App title="My App" />
}
```

The problem with using an object literal like we did in the above examples is
that the builder will NOT be executed in the context of the View.

We can alleviate this issue by returning the builder from an anonymous function:

```
components: {
  '#app': () => <App title={this.title} />
}
```

Even better, we define a `components` method instead:

```
components() {
  return {
    '#app': <App title={this.title} />
  }
}
```

The above example is the recommended technique and the one that will be used
in the remainder of the examples.

## Syncing Models & Collections in State

We can pass models and collections from the View into the React component as
props.

```
components() {
  '#app': <App person={this.person}
               people={this.people}
               addPerson={this.addPerson}
          />
}
```

In the example above, `this.person` is a Backbone.Model and `this.people` is a
Backbone.Collection.

It's important to note that when we do this, we actually cast the models and
collections to JSON, thereby creating plain JavaScript object representations
of them. We wrap the component in a stateful component which stores the
JavaScript object representation of the models and collections in its state.
When the original models or collections change, they are once again cast to
JSON and upated in the state. This causes the props to our mounted component to
change, triggering a re-render if warranted.

You should only use models and collections this way when working with simple
components. If you have a deep component tree, you will need to pass props
through the tree and any changes will result in render checks throughout the
component tree and possible re-renders throughout the component tree. In such
cases, use the store instead.

## Syncing Models & Collections in Store

We learned before that by setting an initial state, we can create a store for
those values instead of storing them in the state of the wrapping component.

When we add models and collections to the initial state, they are cast to JSON
before being stored in the store. When the models or collections change, they
are once again cast to JSON and updated in the store. With this approach, the
component will NOT receive new props and there be no render checks. This is a
more performant solution. Furthermore, we can avoid passing props through the
component tree. We can use the `connect` HOF to grab what we need from the state.
This means that only the connected component will receive new props on state
changes.

This technique, of syncing models and collections in the store, is the
recommended way for mounting entire React apps in a Backbone or Marionette
view where you want to use existing models, collections and instance methods
that operate on those models and collections. Essentially, it allows us to
architect the app using patterns popularized by Redux, creating a path forward
to eventually repace the Backbone or Marionette piece with Redux or a similar
solution. Doing so should not involve much if any changes to the React
app.

```
components() {
  '#app': {
    component: App,
    initialState: {
      person: this.person,
      people: this.people,
    },
    externalActions: {
      addPerson: this.addPerson,
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, we also put some instance methods from the view into the
`externalActions`. These external actions can be retrieved from the store and
passed as props to a component via the `connect` HOF.

You should note that the first argument to `addPerson` in this example will be
the current `state`.

```
import { connect } from '@helpscout/brigade'
import Form from '../Form'

const mapStateToProps = ({ person, people }) => ({ person, people })
const mapActionsToProps = store => {
  const { addPerson } = store.getExternalActions()
  return {
    addPerson: (state, person) => addPerson(person)
  }
}
connect(mapStateToProps, mapActionsToProps)(Form)
```

The above example illustrates how we can grab state and actions out of the store
from any component in our mounted React app using the `connect` HOC that ships
with Brigade.

You will note that actions are rebound to receive the current `state` as the
first argument so if your external action does not accept that argument you
will need to remap the action as shown in the example above.

Since it is common that your external actions will have no concept of the state
or store, we have created a helper method. `store.getStatelessExternalActions()`
returns the external actions where each action has been remapped to remove
`state` as the first argument.

```
const mapActionsToProps = store => {
  const { addPerson } = store.getStatelessExternalActions()
  return { addPerson }
}
connect(null, mapActionsToProps)(Form)
```

You will note in the above example, we do not need to remap the `addPerson`
action. Because we used `store.getStatelessExternalActions()` the first
argument will be the `person`, not the `state`.

## Usage with Backbone Views

While this library was designed to work with Marionette, `ReactMounter` is
compatible with Backbone but it does require a bit of coercing. `ReactMounter`
replies on a `render` event which Marionette implements in its views to know
when it is safe to mount the React components. If you want to use this with
Backbone views you can, but you will need to trigger a `render` event from 
within your `render` method.

For example:

```
import $ from 'jquery'
import Backbone from 'backbone'
import React from 'react'
import { ReactMounter} from '@helpscout/brigade'

const MyComponent = () => <div>Hello World</div>

const AppView = ReactMounter(Backbone.View.extend({
  el: $('#app'),

  components: {
    '#my-component': MyComponent
  },

  render() {
    this.$el.html('<div id="my-component"></div>')
    this.trigger('render')
    return this
  }
}))

const appView = new AppView()
appView.render()
```

## Ideal Use Case

ReactMounter is ideally suited for mounting one or more complex React components
or entire React applications inside a Backbone or Marionette View, particularly
where all of the business logic and state is controlled in the Backbone or 
Marionette app and you are interested in syncing its state with React components
or apps.

In cases where you want to use Redux to manage state or where you are interested
in migrating to a Redux architecture, you should use [StatefulReactView](/stateful-react-view)
instead.
