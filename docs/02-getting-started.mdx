# Getting Started

## Dependencies

Before getting started, make sure you have the required dependencies to use
Brigade.

### Peer Dependencies:

- [Backbone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone)
- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [React DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

### Optional Peer Dependencies

- [Marionette](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone.marionette)

### Notes

- Backbone requires jQuery and underscore.
- brigade.ReactMounter should work with any version of Backbone or Marionette
- brigade.ReactView only supports Marionette 1.8.*
- brigade.StatefulReactView only supports Marionette 1.8.*
- React 15 and 16 are supported

## Insallation

Install Brigade in your project using a package manager. Here we are assuming
that you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm).

```
npm i -S @helpscout/brigade
```

## Choose Your Flavor

Brigade includes three higher-order functions (HOF) to help you integrate React
into your Backbone or Marionette apps.

All three HOFs have the same API. Invoke the HOF with a View to create a new View that is
enhanced with React capabilities.

```
import Marionette from 'backbone.marionette'
import {ReactMounter, ReactView, StatefulReactView } from '@helpscout/brigade'

const ViewA = ReactMounter(Marionette.ItemView)
const ViewB = ReactView(Marionette.ItemView)
const ViewC = StatefulReactView(Marionette.ItemView)
```

The signature of each HOF is the same, but the differences end there. They
accomodate three distinct means of integrating React into a Backbone or
Marionette application.

1. ReactMounter mounts one or more React components inside a Backbone or Marionette View.
2. ReactView uses React as the template layer in a Marionette ItemView.
3. StatefulReactView also uses React as the template layer in a Marionette ItemView and it expects to be passed a 
   Redux store, which is smashed into a `<Provider>` that wraps the component returned from `template()`.

It is recommended that you learn all three of these HOFs and then choose the
one that best suits the task at hand.

## Migrating from 0.x to 1.x

Brigade 1.0.0 drops the default export. Users need to pick a flavour, importing
ReactMounter, ReactView, or StatefulReactView depending on their use case.

If you are moving from 0.x to 1.x you should replace:

```
import brigade from '@helpscout/brigade'
...
const View = brigade(Marionette.ItemView)
```

with:

```
import {ReactMounter} from '@helpscout/brigade'
...
const View = ReactMounter(Marionette.ItemView)
```

ReactMounter builds on the default export from Brigade 0.3. The API for the
`components` property added to the View has changed so you will need to learn
about the differences and update your Views accordingingly. The new API is
simpler, more flexible, and more powerful.

For Marionette users specifically, you may find the new ReactView useful as a
simple replacement for the template layer in Marionette.ItemView. You may also 
find StatefulReactView useful as a replacement for the template layer
in Marionette.ItemView which uses Redux as a store.
