# Getting Started

## Installation

Install Brigade in your project using a package manager. Here we are assuming
that you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm).

```
npm i -S @helpscout/brigade
```

## Using

Under the hood, Brigade uses [Cocktail](https://github.com/onsi/cocktail) to
mixin functionality into your Backbone or Marionette views.

### Basic Usage

1. Import the `brigade` function into your view file.
2. Include a `components` property or method in your view.
3. Invoke the `brigade` function with your view as the argument before exporting.

```javascript
import brigade from '@helpscout/brigade'
import Marionette from 'backbone.marionette'
import React from 'react'
import _ from 'underscore'

import Button from '@helpscout/hsds-react/components/Button'

const FormView = Marionette.View.extend({
  components: {
    '.js-button': <Button primary submit>Save</Button>
  },

  // This can also be written as:
  // components() {
  //   return {
  //     'js-button': <Button primary submit>Save</Button>
  //   }
  // }

  template: _.template(`
    <form>
      <fieldset>
        <label>Email address</label>
        <input type="email" placeholder="Enter your email" />
      </fieldset>
      <div class="js-button"></div>
    </form>
  `),
})

export default brigade(FormView)
```

Use the view in your application as you normally would. When the view is
rendered, Brigade will handle iterating over the key-value pairs in the
`components` property (or returned from the `components` method) and mount
the `component` defined in the `value` into the element in the view that matches
the `selector` defined in the `key`.

In the example above, when the view is rendered, the `Button` component will be
mounted into the `div` with the classname of `js-button` inside the `FormView`
instance.

The `components` property or method is a powerful construct. See the next
section on [Components](/components) for more advanced usage.
