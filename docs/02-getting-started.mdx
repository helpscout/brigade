# Getting Started

## Dependencies

Before getting started, make sure you have the required dependencies to use
Brigade.

### Peer Dependencies:

- [Backbone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone)
- [React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [React DOM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)

### Optional Peer Dependencies

- [Marionette](https://www.npmjs.com/package/backbone.marionette)

### Notes

- Backbone requires jQuery and underscore.
- brigade.ReactMounter should work with any version of Backbone or Marionette
- brigade.ReactView only supports Marionette 1.8.*
- React 15 and 16 are supported

## Insallation

Install Brigade in your project using a package manager. Here we are assuming
that you are using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm).

```
npm i -S @helpscout/brigade
```

## Choose Your Flavor

Brigade includes two higher-order functions (HOF) to help you integrate React
into your Backbone or Marionette apps.

Both HOFS have the same API. Invoke the HOF with a View to create a new View
that is enhanced with React capabilities.

```
import Marionette from 'backbone.marionette'
import {ReactMounter, ReactView} from '@helpscout/brigade'

const ViewA = ReactMounter(Marionette.ItemView)
const ViewB = ReactView(Marionette.ItemView)
```

The signature of each HOF is the same, but the differences end there. They
accomodate two distinct means of integrating React into a Backbone or
Marionette application.

1. ReactMounter mounts React components inside a Backbone or Marionette View.
2. ReactView uses React as the template layer in a Marionette ItemView.

It is recommended that you learn about both of these HOFs and then choose the
one that best suits the task at hand.

## Migrating from 0.x to 1.x

Brigade 1.0.0 drops the default export. Users need to pick a flavour, importing
ReactMounter or ReactView, depending on their use case.

If you are moving from 0.x to 1.x you should replace:

```
import brigade from '@helpscout/brigade'
...
const View = brigade(Marionette.ItemView)
```

with:

```
import {ReactMounter} from '@helpscout/brigade'
...
const View = ReactMounter(Marionette.ItemView)
```

ReactMounter builds on the default export from Brigade 0.3. The API for the
`components` property added to the View has changed so you will need to learn
about the differences and update your Views accordingingly. The new API is
simpler, more flexible, and more powerful.
